### Reflection:

This lesson really helped me understand how variables work in Java and why choosing the right data type matters. I realized that variables are like labeled boxes in memory, and picking the correct type—like int for whole numbers or boolean for true/false—makes coding much clearer and less error-prone. I also found it interesting to see the difference between primitive types and reference types like Strings, especially how Strings have methods I can use to manipulate text. Doing the popcorn hacks and writing my own small programs made the concepts feel real, and I feel more confident now about storing and using information correctly in my code.
