When I started this course in August, my recent programming experience was nearly all Python based machine learning building like brain circuit modeling. This is so, since I interned at Boston University's RISE program as a computational neurobiologist. It had been a year since CSP, so a lot of my fullstack development skills were a little rusty. Joining CSA was a great decision, since through this trimester I've relearned fullstack programming, data handling, and built a strong foundation in Java.

I relearned Git workflows and branching strategies. The Pong Game project helped me relearn the Java I covered in CSP, and learn the fundamentls of OOP, and with the team teaches I learned various new and exciting Java concepts. In our recent projects, I my fullstack development skills enhanced with my API testing, and frontend and backend integration. Additionally, I realized how with the Spring Data JPA I could define methods and let the framework generate queries automatically. Building our team's Data Visualization project required integrating JavaScriptfor search filtering with RESTful API design on the backend, managing databases, and implementing pagination.

As someone who's applied as a CS major in my colleges, I'm excited to apply these fundamentals throughout my future and in the upcoming trimesters, finding out how to integrate my team's project with other groups.
