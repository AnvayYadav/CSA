## Overview

Our team presented an interactive educational web application teaching Spring Boot, REST APIs, and database concepts. The project featured simulators, code challenges, and demonstrations of backend development principles.

### Guest Feedback Analysis

We recieved seven feedback comments through microblogging on our page.

Multiple parents praised the project's interactive nature, and how we had interaction beyond just normal MCQ  quiz formats. The favorite interactive elements mentioned were the API Simulator, Query Builder, and live search interface allowing visitors to experiment with backend concepts in real-time.

The theme, colors, and lesson strcture created a nice professional aesthetic. Parents really appreciated a easy to follow format, so with my future projects I'll aim to structure them with a level of detail found in this one.

One suggestion was to have "a way to provide some examples for the user during their initial journey to familiarize with the tool." This constructive feedback points to having familiarizing elements beyond the "Cheat Fill" button which auto-populated forms with sample data. We could pre-load example searches to demonstrate capabilities and have a "getting started" guide to perhaps make it slightly easier.

Overall, our project had overwhelmingly positive feedback and I would consider our experience a success.

Night at the Museum was great this trimester. This is because in addition to the support and feedback from the parents, we also had a chance to work collaboratively as a team and discuss future plans with Mr. Mortensen.
